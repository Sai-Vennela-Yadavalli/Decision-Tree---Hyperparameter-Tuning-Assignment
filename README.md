# 🌳 Decision Tree – Hyperparameter Tuning Assignment

This repository contains a baby assignment on **Decision Tree Regressor**, focusing on evaluating different combinations of `criterion` and `splitter` parameters to find the best-performing model based on R² Score.

---

## 📄 Assignment Summary

- **Model:** DecisionTreeRegressor (from scikit-learn)
- **Goal:** Tune hyperparameters and evaluate R² score
- **Parameters Tested:**
  - `criterion`: `"squared_error"`, `"friedman_mse"`, `"absolute_error"`, `"poisson"`
  - `splitter`: `"best"`, `"random"`

---

## 🏆 Best Performing Combination

According to the assignment results:
criterion = "friedman_mse"
splitter = "random"
R² Score = 0.96
